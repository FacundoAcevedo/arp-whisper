# arp-whisper üì°

Welcome to the arp-whisper project! üéâ

## Description

arp-whisper is an open-source project written in Rust. It listens to ARP requests on a network interface and responds to them based on a list of IP-MAC address mappings defined in a configuration file. With arp-whisper, you can easily create an ARP responder to handle network queries and provide the appropriate MAC address for each IP address.

## How It Works

arp-whisper continuously monitors incoming ARP requests on the specified network interface. It checks if the request's target IP address matches any of the IP addresses in the configuration file. If a match is found, arp-whisper generates an ARP response with the corresponding MAC address and sends it back to the requester.

## Installation

To install arp-whisper, ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed, then run the following command:

```shell
cargo install arp-whisper
```

### Systemd service

To install the service run:

```shell
sudo install -o root -g root -m 644 etc/arp-whisper.service /etc/systemd/system/
# Reload the daemon
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# Start the service
sudo systemctl start arp-whisper
```

### AppArmor profile

`arp-whisper` has to be installed in `/usr/bin/arp-whisper`

```shell
sudo install -o root -g root -m 644 /path/to/your/usr.bin.arp-whisper /etc/apparmor.d/
# Load the profile
sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.arp-whisper
```

## Configuration Example

You can configure arp-whisper using a configuration file. Here's an example of the configuration file format:

```ini
; Optional field
; Default value: info
; Possible values: info, warn, debug, off
logging_level = "debug"
[Network]
interface = eth0

[Hosts]
; ip = mac_address
192.168.1.2 = aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
192.168.1.3 = 00:11:22:33:44:55
```

In this example, the [Network] section specifies the network interface to listen on, and the [Hosts] section defines the IP-MAC address mappings.
How to Run

To run arp-whisper with your configuration file, use the following command:

```shell
sudo arp-whisper config.ini
```

Replace config.ini with the path to your actual configuration file.
